   <h2 class="info">History</h2>
   <p>Charles Babage was born on the 26 of December 1791.Charles was the son of a banker and was mainly homeschooled.<br>He was interested in mathematics by the time he went to Cambridge University in 1810.</p>

   <h2 class="info">Achievements</h2>
   <p>In, 1812,Babbage Helped founded the Analitical socity,a group of people that brought developments from european continent into english mathematics. <br>He also ccontributed to the founding of the Royal Astronomical (1820) and the Statistical Societies (1834).</p>

   <h2 class="info">The Difference Machine</h2>
   <p>In 1823, Babbage got fiancial support from the government to design a device called the Differnce machine to solve  equations in a matter of seconds.<br>The machine operates by teethed wheels from 0 to 9.When the toothed wheels turned from nine to zero, it causes the wheel to carry the number to the higher position.The machine had a storage to store data, just like modern computers.Unfortunatly, all  contruction came to a halt in 1833.</p>

   <h2 class="info">Legacy</h2>
   <p>Although Babbage fail to construct the difference machine, his concept revolutionize the idea of a computer that we see today.</p>
